# 3D Dance Motion and Evaluation Dataset  
  We created Dataset for Dance Performance Analysis  
  Dataset includes videos, motions and evaluations.  
  Subjects are students from elementary school to university who are learning dance at a dance studio.  
    
  Videos are not available now.    
  Motion data is available at https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1DYGHbrxAEtDcVPCeM_oZyXNpEGZD4S8G
