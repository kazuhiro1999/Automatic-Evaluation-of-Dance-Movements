# Automatic Evaluation of Dance Performance
  Welcome to our project! Here, we develop AI models for evaluating dance performance using our unique dataset, Dance Database for Performance Analysis (DDPA). Explore our dataset, model training demos, and the dance evaluation annotation tool.  
    
## Dataset  
  This dance dataset was collected with the cooperation of students ranging from elementary school students to college students who attend a dance studio. The dataset includes video data, 3D motion data inferred from the videos, and evaluation data for the dance.

  The original dance performance videos are available at [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1gpFwfQfyTHlhG6PmXiqpz215XJ4dK7TY).  
  Dance motion data is available at [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1DYGHbrxAEtDcVPCeM_oZyXNpEGZD4S8G).  
  The evaluation data is available at [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HhCZ1SrpI4E-5IE2cGAoJcP8LcyuVlyJ).   
  
  To respect copyright issues, all audio has been removed from these videos. Please note that the music used in these dance sequences can be listened to [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjsjfBtFTJI), starting from the 17-second mark. 

## Model Training  
  Training Demo is available at Google Colaboratory

## Annotation Tool  
  We have created a dance evaluation tool for the purpose of annotating evaluations on the dance performances. This tool aids in providing structured feedback based on specific aspects of each dance performance.  
  A sample of the annotation tool is available for use and can be accessed at [here](https://kazuhiro1999.github.io/Automatic-Evaluation-of-Dance-Movements/).
